/**
 *  Using NWMethodWrapper objects, method calls to instances of a specified class, or method calls to
 *  a specified class itself can be "wrapped" between 2 blocks that will be called resp. before and after
 *  calling the original method implementation.
 *
 *  Example: 
 *  Let's assume we have a class called NWMediaPlayer, which e.g. implements an instance method -playSource:
 *  Using a method wrapper we can have a block executed before the actual -playSource: is called, and we can
 *  have a block executed after the actual -playSource: is called:
 *
 *  [NWMethodWrapper wrap:[NWMediaPlayer class] instanceMethodForSelector:@selector(playSource:)
                   before:(ImpBlock)^(id _self, id<NPOSource> _source) {
                                // This block will be executed BEFORE the original implementation of -playSource:
                          }
                    after:(ImpBlock)^(id _self, id<NPOSource> _source) {
                                // This block will be executed AFTER the original implementation of -playSource:
                          }];
 *
 *  Also note that the first argument is id _self. This will contain a reference to the object on which the
 *  -playSource: is being called. After the first argument, optional arguments are passed, that were passed
 *  in when calling the -playSource: method. The number of arguments is currently limited to 6. Also the
 *  supported types of arguments is limited. Structs, unions and C arrays are not supported. This could be
 *  fixed in the future by using libffi to call the variadic blocks / original implemenation.
 *  Note that the block is typecasted to a generic ImpBlock. This is to avoid compiler errors.
 *
 *  The +wrap:... convenience methods return an autoreleased NWMethodWrapper instance. The wrapping will be
 *  activated for you by this convenience method.
 *  Note that once the instance gets deallocated, the wrapping will be cleaned up, so you need to retain the
 *  wrapper instances to keep the wrapping in effect.
